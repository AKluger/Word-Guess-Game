//   doneYet(userGuess);
  //basically I want to create a funciton that checks if character matches guess, then I want to call that function for each character.

  //function to call when guess is wrong
    // function wrongGuess()   {
        // lettersGuessed.push(" " + userGuess);
        // numOfGuesses--;
    
  //or we could copy cargame, if guess=b current word [0] = userGuess or a or g or e or l
   // so first we're adding userGuess to currentGuesses if not already there or in currentWord, and counting down guesses with g--.  THEN we are checking guess against currentWord.
   
//else if ( userGuess !== l for l== lettersGuessed.charAt(l))  {

 
  
// .join can connect the word string when game has been solved.

// assign currentWord as an array. Display as an array of "_ " for [l] in currentWord if [l] is in lettersGuessed then return l otherwise "_ ". with getElementbyID
//something like if letter does not appear in word
//use str search, assigning new variable, if var is >-1, userGuess appears in currentWord.  So how do we return the filled in letter plus empty spaces?


//if currentWord exists in currentGuesses then wins++ and move to next round.  If numOfGuesses.length>9 then also go to next word.  Next word is going to be a whole new page?  How do we keep # of wins throughout, with getElementbyID?

//if None of the currentWord array are blanks then win++ and move on to next word

// for (var i = 0; i < randomWord.length; i++) {
//     var finish = true
//     if (randomWord[i]===" _")  {
//         finish = false;
//     }

//     else if (finish) {
//         word 
//         wins++;
//     }
